Why is this useful? For those who haven't memorized secrets, trying to find secrets takes forever, especially when you have to spend a ton of time searching through DT channels for the right room. This mod makes it easy as you can immediately see where a secret is.

Is this bannable? No. Because our mod is made by us viewing and adding where each secret is for each room no kinds of esp or anything is used. You may notice that bat spawns are not where our mod says they are. That's because, if the bat is already moving around we only have the spawn location marked.
